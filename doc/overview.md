## Basics

### What is the Mimir Bridge?

The Mimir Bridge is a second-layer security and scaling solution for Blockchain networks
and Decentralized Applications.  The goal of this project is to make the development, 
deployment, and use of Decentralized Applications as convenient and seamless as possible,
without compromising security and trustlessness.  At its core, the Mimir Bridge is a mechanism
for establishing maximal security with minimum cost in terms of time and resources.  This
is especially appealing for limited contexts such as Mobile or IoT devices but stands to 
reduce cost and complexity in Cloud and Native applications as well.
